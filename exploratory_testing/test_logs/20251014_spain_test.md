# Test Log: Spain Market Test (ES)

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Tester**: Development Team
**Test ID**: ES-001

## Test Objective
Verify that the scraper correctly extracts product data from Amazon Spain (amazon.es) with English keywords and multi-language BSR extraction.

## Test Setup
- **Country**: Spain (es)
- **Domain**: amazon.es
- **Currency**: EUR
- **Keywords**: "wireless headphones" (English)
- **Max Products**: 10
- **Concurrency**: 1
- **Proxy**: ScraperAPI with country_code=es

## Test Steps
1. Set config.json country to "es"
2. Run scraper with keyword "wireless headphones"
3. Verify output in output/es/ directory
4. Check product data completeness

## Expected Results
- 10 products extracted successfully
- All fields populated: ASIN, title, price, rating, review_count, badges, BSR, images
- Spanish language data in titles and badges
- BSR extracted using Spanish patterns
- No sponsored products included
- Output organized in output/es/ folder

## Actual Results
- ✅ 10 products extracted successfully
- ✅ ASINs correct (e.g., B0D6YMGXBF, B0BTJ8ZXG5)
- ✅ Titles in Spanish language
- ✅ Prices in EUR (14.99, 33.99, 29.99, etc.)
- ✅ Ratings all showing 4.0
- ✅ Review counts showing 99 (some showing 0)
- ✅ Badges in Spanish (e.g., "Opción Amazon", "Más vendido")
- ⚠️ BSR extracted for 2/10 products only:
  - B08VD6SRBZ: "Open-Ear Headphones"
  - B0D9YZQVQT: "Headphones & Earphones"
- ✅ Images extracted (6 per product)
- ✅ No sponsored products
- ✅ Output in output/es/ directory

## Findings

### Issue 1: Inconsistent BSR Extraction
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Only 2 out of 10 products have BSR data extracted. 8 products returned null for bsr_category.
**Root Cause**: BSR may not be present on all product pages, or regex patterns not matching all Spanish BSR formats.
**Recommendation**: Add more Spanish BSR pattern variations or log HTML for failed extractions to improve patterns.

### Issue 2: Review Count Standardization
**Severity**: Low
**Description**: One product (B0BTDX26B2) shows review_count: 0 while others show 99.
**Root Cause**: Amazon may display reviews differently for some products, or review count extraction failed.
**Recommendation**: Verify extraction pattern handles all Spanish review formats.

### Issue 3: High Success Rate with Rate Limiting
**Severity**: None (Positive Finding)
**Description**: Concurrency limit of 1 successfully avoids 429 rate limit errors from Firecrawl.
**Recommendation**: Keep concurrency at 1 for production use.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate BSR extraction patterns for Spanish market - test on live product pages
2. Add logging for failed BSR extractions to capture HTML for analysis
3. Test with multiple keywords to verify output organization
4. Test other markets (DE, FR, IT) with same English keywords
5. Consider adding retry logic for individual product failures
