**Evidence**:
- Domain in output: "amazon.co.uk"
- Currency: GBP instead of USD
- Product titles and BSR categories match UK market

**Impact**: US market data is completely invalid

**Root Cause**: Likely configuration mapping issue where "us" country code maps to wrong domain

- Spain: Returns only 3 products
- Germany: Returns 0 products
- US/IT: Not applicable due to other issues

**Analysis**: Amazon's search algorithm has different spelling correction thresholds by market

  "keywords": [
    "berberine 1500mg",
    "berberine high strength",
    "berberine mojo 1500 mg",
    "berberina"  // Skip "berberry supplement"
