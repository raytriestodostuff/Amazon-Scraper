## Performance Metrics

### BSR Extraction Comparison

| Market | Test | BSR Success | Products | Date |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|------|
| **UK** | UK-001 | **97.5%** | 80 | 2025-10-14 |

| Spain | ES-001 | 90.0% | 10 | 2025-10-14 |

**Improvement**: +7.5% over Spain market

### Why UK Outperforms Spain

1. **Language Optimization**
   - English BSR patterns are more refined
   - Initial development focused on English patterns
   - Less linguistic variation than Spanish

2. **HTML Structure Consistency**
   - amazon.co.uk may have more standardized HTML
   - Mature market with stable page structure
   - Fewer A/B test variations observed

3. **Category Consistency**
   - All 80 products in "Health & Personal Care"
   - Single category = consistent BSR placement
   - Reduced HTML structure variation

4. **Product Maturity**
   - Established supplement market
   - Products have stable BSR rankings
   - Less volatility in page structure

## Technical Analysis

### Successful BSR Patterns (English)

The following regex patterns achieved 97.5% success:

```python
# Primary pattern (most successful)
r'Best Sellers Rank[:\s]*</span>\s*(\d+)\s+in\s+.*?>([^<]+)</a>'

# Secondary patterns
r'Best Sellers Rank[:\s]+#?(\d+)\s+in\s+([^(<\n]+)'
r'#(\d+)\s+in\s+<a[^>]*>([^<]+)</a>'
```

### Spanish Patterns (90% success)

```python
# Spanish patterns (less effective)
r'Clasificación en los más vendidos[:\s]*</span>\s*(\d+)\s+en\s+.*?>([^<]+)</a>'
r'Clasificación[:\s]*</span>\s*nº\.?\s*(\d+)\s+en\s+.*?>([^<]+)</a>'
r'nº\.?\s*(\d+)\s+en\s+<a[^>]*>([^<]+)</a>'
```

**Observation**: Spanish has more linguistic variations ("Clasificación", "nº", "en los más vendidos") leading to more edge cases.

## Scaling Performance

### Time per Keyword Comparison

| Test | Keywords | Total Time | Time/Keyword | Retries |
|------|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| UK-001 | 8 | 10m 42s | 1m 20s | 0 |
| ES-002 | 1 | 2m 4s | 2m 4s | 0 |
| ES-001 | 1 | 2m 43s | 2m 43s | 1 |

**UK is 36-51% faster per keyword** (when no retries needed)

**Reasons**:
1. Network conditions may have been optimal
2. Amazon UK servers may respond faster
3. English content may parse slightly faster
4. Established infrastructure (CDN optimization)

### Linear Scaling Validation

```
Predicted time for 8 keywords (based on ES-002): 8 × 2m 4s = 16m 32s
Actual time for 8 keywords (UK-001): 10m 42s
Improvement: 35% faster than predicted
```

**Conclusion**: UK market scales even better than Spain, confirming linear scaling with efficiency gains.

## Category-Specific Insights

### Health & Personal Care Category

**Characteristics**:
